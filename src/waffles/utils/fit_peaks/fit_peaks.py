    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration_histogram: CalibrationHistogram
        The CalibrationHistogram object to fit peaks on
    max_peaks: int
        It must be a positive integer. It gives the
        maximum number of peaks that could be possibly
        fit. This parameter is passed to the 'max_peaks'
        parameter of the 
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram()
        function.
    min_distance_between_neighbouring_peaks: int
        It must be a positive integer. It gives the
        required minimal horizontal distance, in number
        of bins, between neighbouring peaks of the charge
        histogram. It is useful to avoid spotting
        statistical fluctuations as peaks. This parameter
        is passed to the 'min_distance_between_neighbouring_peaks'
        parameter of the
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram() function,
        which uses it as the 'distance' parameter of the
        scipy.signal.find_peaks() function.
    prominence: float
        It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0.
        It gives the minimal prominence of the peaks to 
        spot. This parameter is passed to the 'prominence' 
        parameter of the 
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram()
        function, where it is interpreted as the fraction 
        of the total amplitude of the histogram which is 
        required for a peak to be spotted as such. P.e. 
        setting prominence to 0.5, will prevent 
        scipy.signal.find_peaks() from spotting peaks 
        whose amplitude is less than half of the total 
        amplitude of the histogram.
    initial_percentage: float
        It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0.
        This parameter is passed to the 'initial_percentage' 
        parameter of the 
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram()
        function. For more information, check the 
        documentation of such function.
    percentage_step: float
        It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0.
        This parameter is passed to the 'percentage_step' 
        parameter of the 
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram() 
        function. For more information, check the 
        documentation of such function.
    return_last_addition_if_fail: bool
        This parameter is given to the
        return_last_addition_if_fail parameter of the
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram()
        function. It makes a difference only if the
        specified number of peaks (max_peaks) is not
        found. For more information, check the
        documentation of the 
        wuff.__spot_first_peaks_in_CalibrationHistogram()
        function.
    fit_type: str
        The supported values are 'independent_gaussians',
        'correlated_gaussians' and 'multigauss_iminuit'. If
        any other value is given, the
        'independent_gaussians' value will be used instead.
        If the 'independent_gaussians' value is used, the
        function will fit each peak independently, i.e. it
        will fit a gaussian function to each peak
        independently of the others. For more information on
        this type of fit, check the documentation of the
        wuff.__fit_independent_gaussians_to_calibration_histogram()
        function. If the 'correlated_gaussians' value is
        given, the function will fit all of the peaks at
        once using a fitting function which is a sum of
        gaussians whose means and standard deviations are
        correlated. For more information on this type of
        fit, check the documentation of the
        wuff.__fit_correlated_gaussians_to_calibration_histogram()
        function.
    weigh_fit_by_poisson_sigmas: bool
        If it is set to True, and fit_type is set to
        'independent_gaussians' or 'correlated_gaussians',
        then the gaussian least squares fit will be weighed
        by the Poisson standard deviation of each bin. If
        fit_type is set to 'multigauss_iminuit', this
        parameter only affects the initial seed values
        which are calculated using the
        wuff.__fit_independent_gaussians_to_calibration_histogram()
        function.
    half_points_to_fit: int
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'independent_gaussians'.
        It must be a positive integer. For each peak, it 
        gives the number of points to consider on either 
        side of the peak maximum, to fit each gaussian 
        function. I.e. if i is the iterator value for
        calibration_histogram.counts of the i-th peak, 
        then the histogram bins which will be considered 
        for the fit are given by the slice 
        calibration_histogram.counts[i - half_points_to_fit : i + half_points_to_fit + 1].
    std_increment_seed_fallback: float
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'correlated_gaussians'.
        In that case, it is given to the
        std_increment_seed_fallback parameter of the
        wuff.__fit_correlated_gaussians_to_calibration_histogram()
        function. For more information, check the
        documentation of such function.
    ch_span_fraction_around_peaks: float
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'correlated_gaussians'.
        In that case, it is given to the
        ch_span_fraction_around_peaks parameter of the
        wuff.__fit_correlated_gaussians_to_calibration_histogram()
        function. For more information, check the
        documentation of such function.
    force_max_peaks: bool
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'multigauss_iminuit'.
        If it is set to True, the function will try to
        fit exactly max_peaks number of peaks using
        iminuit, even if less peaks were found in the
        previous step. If it is set to False, the
        function will to estimate the number of peaks
        using as starting point the number of peaks
        found in the previous step plus 15 extra peaks.
    fit_limits: list
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'multigauss_iminuit'.
        It must be a list of two elements, which can
        be either float or None. If the first element
        is not None, it gives the lower limit of the
        x values to consider for the iminuit fit.
        If the second element is not None, it gives
        the upper limit of the x values to consider
        for the iminuit fit.


    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the number of found-and-fitted peaks matches
        the given max_peaks parameter, and False if it is
        smaller than max_peaks.

        function for each calibration histogram.
    min_distance_between_neighbouring_peaks: int
        It must be a positive integer. It gives the
        required minimal horizontal distance, in number
        of bins, between neighbouring peaks of the charge
        histogram. It is useful to avoid spotting

        This parameter is given to the
        return_last_addition_if_fail parameter of the
        fit_peaks_of_CalibrationHistogram() function. It

        of peaks (max_peaks) is not found. For more
        information, check the documentation of the

    fit_type: str
        The only supported values are 'independent_gaussians'
        and 'correlated_gaussians'. If any other value is
        given, the 'independent_gaussians' value will be
        used instead. This parameter is passed to the
        'fit_type' parameter of the fit_peaks_of_CalibrationHistogram()
        function for each calibration histogram. For more 
        information, check the documentation of such function.

        function for each calibration histogram. For more 
        information, check the documentation of such function.
    half_points_to_fit: int
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'independent_gaussians'.
        It must be a positive integer. For each peak in
        each calibration histogram, it gives the number 
        of points to consider on either side of the peak 
        maximum, to fit each gaussian function. It is
        given to the 'half_points_to_fit' parameter of
        the fit_peaks_of_CalibrationHistogram() function 
        for each calibration histogram. For more information, 
        check the documentation of such function.
    std_increment_seed_fallback: float
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'correlated_gaussians'.
        For more information, check the documentation
        of the fit_peaks_of_CalibrationHistogram()
        function.
    ch_span_fraction_around_peaks: float
        This parameter is only used if the fit_type
        parameter is set to 'correlated_gaussians'.
        For more information, check the documentation
        of the fit_peaks_of_CalibrationHistogram()
        function.
